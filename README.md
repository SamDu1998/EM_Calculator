# EM Calculator

EM Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and the `ttkbootstrap` library. It provides tools for calculating various electromagnetic parameters such as aperture efficiency and relative bandwidth.

## Features

- **Aperture Efficiency Calculation**: Calculate the aperture efficiency of an antenna based on frequency, gain, and area.
- **Relative Bandwidth Calculation**: Calculate the relative bandwidth of a signal based on low and high frequencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `ttkbootstrap` library
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)
